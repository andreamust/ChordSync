Code for ChordSync, a conformer-based audio-to-chord synchroniser. The code is based on the paper "ChordSync: A Conformer-based Audio-to-Chord Synchroniser" presented at the 2024 Sound and Music Computing Conference, which is available [here](https://smcnetwork.org/smc2024/papers/SMC2024_paper_id205.pdf).

The code contains both the code for re-training the model and reproducing the experiments presented in the paper and the code for running the synchronisation on new audio files.

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Setup and Installation

The code is written in Python 3.11 and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) 2.2.0.
We suggest to create a new conda environment to run the code.
To create a new conda environment, run:

```bash
conda create -n chordsync python=3.11
conda activate chordsync
```

To install the required packages, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üß† Training the Model

### üìä Data Preparation

The model is trained using a subset of the chord annotations included [ChoCo](https://github.com/smahub/ChoCo), the Chord Corpus dataset.
However, the audio files are not included in this repository for copyright reasons.

All the `JAMS` files containing the annotations and the adio files should be placed in two different folders, and the names of the files should match.
For pre-processing the data, run:

```bash
python ChordSync/data/data_preprocessing.py --audio_folder path/to/audio/folder --jams_folder path/to/jams/folder -max_sequence_length 15 --excerpt_per_song 25 --excerpt_distance 12 --cache_name cache --device cpu --num_workers 4
```

A new folder named `cache` will be created, containing the pre-processed data.
The audio files are pre-processed as mel-spectrograms, as described in the paper. However, it is possible to extract other features by passing the `--feature_type` argument.

### üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Training

The model training uses PyTorch Lightning. For training the model using the
parameters described in the paper, run:

```bash
python ChordSync/train.py
```

## üîÅ Running the Synchronisation

To run the synchronisation on a new audio file, run:

```bash
python ChordSync/sync.py --audio_file path/to/audio/file --model_path models/chordsync_v.0.1.0.ckpt --output_folder path/to/output/folder --device cpu
```
